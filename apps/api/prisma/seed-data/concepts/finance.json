      "definition": "A pricing strategy that sets prices based on customer perceived value rather than production costs or competitor pricing.",
      "extendedDescription": "Value-based pricing focuses on understanding what customers are willing to pay based on the benefits they receive. This approach requires deep customer research, understanding of pain points, and clear articulation of your unique value proposition. Companies using this strategy often achieve higher margins because they capture more of the value they create.",

      "extendedDescription": "Cost-plus pricing is straightforward: calculate all costs (materials, labor, overhead) and add a desired profit margin. While simple to implement, this method ignores customer willingness to pay and competitor pricing. It's commonly used in manufacturing, construction, and government contracts where costs are transparent.",

Products with elastic demand see significant demand drops when prices rise, while inelastic products maintain demand. Understanding elasticity helps optimize pricing for maximum revenue.",
