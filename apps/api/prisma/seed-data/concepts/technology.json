      "definition": "The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.",
      "extendedDescription": "Technical debt accumulates when teams take shortcuts to meet deadlines. Like financial debt, it accrues interest over time through slower development, more bugs, and harder maintenance. Managing technical debt requires tracking, prioritizing, and allocating time for refactoring. Some debt is strategic; most is accidental.",

      "extendedDescription": "Scalability patterns include horizontal scaling (adding machines), vertical scaling (adding power), caching, database sharding, and load balancing. The right approach depends on the bottleneck. Designing for scalability early is easier than retrofitting, but premature optimization can waste resources.",
